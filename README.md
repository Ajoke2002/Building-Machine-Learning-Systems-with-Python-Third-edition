This is the code repository for [Building Machine Learning Systems with Python - Third edition](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/building-machine-learning-systems-python-third-edition?utm_source=repository&utm_medium=github&utm_campaign=repository&utm_term=9781788623223), published by Packt.

**Explore machine learning and deep learning techniques for building intelligent systems using scikit-learn and TensorFlow**

## What is this book about?
Machine learning allows systems to learn without being explicitly programmed. Python is one of the most popular languages used to develop machine learning applications which take advantage of its extensive library support. This third edition of Building Machine Learning Systems with Python addresses recent developments in the field, by covering the most used datasets and libraries to help you build practical machine learning systems.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Build a classification system that can be applied to text, image, and sound
* Employ Amazon Web Services (AWS) to run analysis on the cloud
* Solve problems related to regression using TensorFlow
* Recommend products to users based on their past purchases
* Explore the steps required to add collaborative filtering using TensorFlow

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter01.

The code will look like the following:
```
 def fetch_posts(fn):
     for line in open(fn, "r"):
         post_id, text = line.split("\t")
         yield int(post_id), text.strip()
 
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
Building Machine Learning Systems with Python is for data scientists, machine learning developers, and Python developers who want to learn how to build increasingly complex machine learning systems. You will use Python's machine learning capabilities to develop effective solutions. Prior knowledge of Python programming is expected.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-3).
